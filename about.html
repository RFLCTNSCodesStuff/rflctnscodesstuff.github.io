    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h1>私について</h1>
    <h3>Who are you?</h3><br>
    <p>I'm an up-and-coming musician, author, artist, gamer, and photographer with interests in franchises like <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou</a>, <a href="http://lenen.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Len'en_Project">Len'en</a>, <a href="https://celestegame.com">Celeste</a>, Pokémon, and more.</p></br>

    <h3>Is there anything more we should know about you?</h3><br>
    <p>I'm the host of an <a href="https://www.pluralpedia.org/w/Endogenic">endogenic</a> <a href="https://www.pluralpedia.org/w/System">system</a> that resulted from my tinkering with various characters; some of them are mine, others aren't. These characters live alongside me within my mind, even though some of those characters come from different worlds than mine.</p><br>

    <p>Additionally, I'm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity">neurodivergent</a>, with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at a young age; as such, I have strong intellect and creativity, which is (presumably) what led to the formation of my original characters and system.</p>
